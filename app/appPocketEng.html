            <h1 class="page-title">Blockchain pocket money</h1>

            <p><b>Idea</b>: Create a simple mechanism for regular payments, for example sending pocket money to children every month. The "cryptocurrency direct debit" would have the same form. </p>
            <p><b>Functioning</b>: Parent will set an amount, a time-period and an Ethereum address of the child and send enough money to the contract address. Afterwards the child is allowed to withdraw this set amount of money in regular intervals. Not more and not more frequently.  </p>
            <p><b>Advantages</b>: Parent can change all the conditions anytime, as well as add new children or everyone else, that will be allowed to withdraw money from his "account." In the case of direct debit it would get rid of a middleman (the bank), which is making the transactions more expensive. </p>
            <p><b>Disadvantages</b>: After withdrawing all the initially sent money the parent has to send more money, so that children have something to withdraw from. (It is unbelievable, but even blockchain cannot create perpetuum mobile for money*.)  </p>
