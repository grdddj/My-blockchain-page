            <p><b>Idea</b>: Create a transparent mechanism for expressing public opinions, where the process is governed by independent platform and cannot be influenced by any centralised authority.  </p>
            <p><b>Functioning</b>: Everybody can create a voting process and define its characteristics - list the choices, give the voting a time condition and create a set of users that can participate in the voting. Users then have a possibility to interact with this voting according to the set rules and express their opinion.    </p>
            <p><b>Advantages</b>: Thanks to cryptographically secured platform one can rely on the correctness of the voting, that for example nobody voted twice or otherwise influenced the result. Easily programmable platform allows for arbitrary voting formats - from the fully public ones to the the most anonymous ones - while always maintaining the integrity of the voting. </p>
            <p><b>Disadvantages</b>: Because each user can generate practically infinite amount of public addresses (and try to vote with all of them), to really count on the result it is necessary to correctly define the set of public addresses that are allowed to vote. Each user should be therefore clearly connected with one public address, and this connection needs to be known up front.  </p>
