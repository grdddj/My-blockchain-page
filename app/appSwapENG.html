            <h1 class="page-title">Blockchain exchange</h1>

            <p><b>Idea</b>: To allow exchange of tokens or other digital assets on the internet with foreign people without the need to trust these people or any third party that oversees this exchange. </p>
            <p><b>Functioning</b>: Both parties make an agreement (anyhow, maybe on the platform for this purpose) about a trade of X amount of A tokens for Y amount of B tokens. Then they will send a transaction to the blockchain with data describing this exchange. If data sent by both parties are exactly the same, the tokens will be automatically swapped between these users. Otherwise the exchange will not be carried out at all. (This behaviour is called "Atomic swap," when either both transfers happen successfully, or none of them happen.) </p>
            <p><b>Advantages</b>: There is no need to put trust in anybody but the blockchain platform. Both parties either agree completely on the trade conditions, in which case both tokens change their owners, and when somebody tries to cheat, both tokens will remain to the initial users.</p>
            <p><b>Disadvantages</b>: Currently two transactions are needed to carry out this swap, because the contract needs to be allowed to manipulate with both tokens to make the swap. </p>
